##Nutrition Tracker
Nutrition tracker is an Alexa Skill that helps keep track of your personal health goals while answering any health
related questions you might have. You can ask Nutrition Tracker how many calories are in different foods, and you can
also record the amount of calories you've eaten everyday by adding meals to Nutrition Tracker's queue of past meals that
you've eaten. You can also ask Nutrition Tracker for meal recommendations or advice for dealing with different illnesses.
